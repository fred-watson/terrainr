I apologize for the rapid re-submission!
The README of version 0.6.0 has a disclaimer at the top stating that the 
package is an experimental build relying on as-of-yet unreleased packages.
This is not true.
This release removes that language. 
Otherwise, this release is identical to version 0.6.0.

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.1.2
* ubuntu 20.04 (on GitHub Actions), R devel, 4.1.2, 4.0.5
