Description: Functions for the retrieval and manipulation of 'USGS' National Map 
    data ('<https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/services/>'), enabling users to 
    download elevation and image data for areas of interest. Functions are also 
    provided to transform these data sources into formats that can be used to 
    create 3D elevation models in the Unity rendering engine.
