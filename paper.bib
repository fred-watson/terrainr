This chapter presents an overview of the science process, illustrates examples of the way current approaches to visualization support certain research activities, and suggests a framework by which additional aspects of: (1) science activity, (2) reasoning mode (inference), (3) outcomes, and (4) pre-requisite data and knowledge can be used to better define the role or roles that different visualization tools can play. To bring visualization tools to the fore, it is important to understand clearly the roles that they play within the entire process of scientific investigation including the various tasks that a researcher might undertake and the different kinds of reasoning that the researcher wish visualization to support or enable. The research challenges that are associated with the use and integration of geovisualization tools from a more semantic, process-oriented approach are also summarized. As geovisualization develops, a broader vision is required by which relevant tools and techniques might be orchestrated into something greater than the sum of their parts. This vision is likely to include perspectives from other disciplines and may continue to incorporate techniques and knowledge from cognate fields with expertise in visualization."

  abstract = "The evolution of our understanding of landscape planning and therefore of landscape as a visual resource occurred in parallel with the changes of perception of spatial planning (urban and regional planning), since landscape planning is part of spatial planning. Already in the 1970s the visual landscape was an issue in spatial planning. This can be traced back to the romantic period when the close emotional ties with one’s home country were very important. With the emerging discussion at the end of the 1970s about ecology and ecological planning, more and more the components of natural science of ecological planning were discussed, at the expense of the visual landscape and aesthetics. With the improvement of the possibilities of the digital 3-dimensional (3D) representation of landscape, it seems that landscape as visual resource has once again become more important in the discussion. 3D visualisation will support participation in the planning process and will become an important part of decision support systems in spatial planning. The use of virtual landscapes will help to study processes in the landscape such as fragmentation of landscape and/or urban sprawl."

  abstract = "The development of computer tools for creating and representing virtual worlds has dramatically increased our abilities to capture salient aspects of the environment and communicate them to audiences remote from the landscape under study. The speed and quality of generation of visual imagery, as well as the editing power computers offer, has already dramatically extended the capabilities of practitioners and researchers in representing scenic views. The immersion, motion, and sound offered by virtual worlds may greatly extend the ecological validity of environmental representations and allow for deeper and more meaningful study of the effects of the real world on human experience. However, while the tools are being widely and increasingly adopted, there has been little discussion of the nature of the advantages being gained, nor the cautions that may be necessary. This paper examines the suitability of Virtual Reality (VR) technology for supporting environmental decision-making. We discuss and categorize different aspects of human-computer interfaces and then discuss to what extent the attributes of VR correspond to the needs of landscape representation."

  abstract = {Analysts report spending upwards of 80% of their time on problems in data cleaning. The data cleaning process is inherently iterative, with evolving cleaning workflows that start with basic exploratory data analysis on small samples of dirty data, then refine analysis with more sophisticated/expensive cleaning operators (e.g., crowdsourcing), and finally apply the insights to a full dataset. While an analyst often knows at a logical level what operations need to be done, they often have to manage a large search space of physical operators and parameters. We present Wisteria, a system designed to support the iterative development and optimization of data cleaning workflows, especially ones that utilize the crowd. Wisteria separates logical operations from physical implementations, and driven by analyst feedback, suggests optimizations and/or replacements to the analyst's choice of physical implementation. We highlight research challenges in sampling, in-flight operator replacement, and crowdsourcing. We overview the system architecture and these techniques, then provide a demonstration designed to showcase how Wisteria can improve iterative data analysis and cleaning.

Big data generally refer to massive volumes of data not readily handled by the usual data tools and practices and present unprecedented opportunities for advancing science and informing resource management through data-intensive approaches. The era of big data need not be propelled only by “big science” – the term used to describe large-scale efforts that have had mixed success in the individual-driven culture of ecology. Collectively, ecologists already have big data to bolster the scientific effort – a large volume of distributed, high-value information – but many simply fail to contribute. We encourage ecologists to join the larger scientific community in global initiatives to address major scientific and societal problems by bringing their distributed data to the table and harnessing its collective power. The scientists who contribute such information will be at the forefront of socially relevant science – but will they be ecologists?},

However, these data remain largely inaccessible for a broader segment of users given the computational demands of big data. Climate Engine (http://ClimateEngine.org) is a web-based application that overcomes many computational barriers that users face by employing Google’s parallel cloud-computing platform, Google Earth Engine, to process, visualize, download, and share climate and remote sensing datasets in real time. The software application development and design of Climate Engine is briefly outlined to illustrate the potential for high-performance processing of big data using cloud computing. Second, several examples are presented to highlight a range of climate research and applications related to drought, fire, ecology, and agriculture that can be rapidly generated using Climate Engine. The ability to access climate and remote sensing data archives with on-demand parallel cloud computing has created vast opportunities for advanced natural resource monitoring and process understanding.}",

abstract = {Results generated by planning and futures studies are often too abstract to provide a clear vision of the future to non-specialists. In this study the role of 3D visualization and the challenges in developing and communicating visible visions for our future landscapes is explored. While traditional visualization techniques have been well-known for several hundreds of years digital 3D visualizations are still not yet taken advantage of in long-term planning or in futures studies in general to their full potential. As part of an iterative consultation and participation process a long-term vision for the landscape and land management of the Alport Valley in the Peak District National Park, UK is developed in order to improve the valley's special landscape character, to enhance the valley's visual and recreational attractiveness, to regenerate the woodlands in ways that maximize the long-term benefit of ecology, wildlife and landscape and to get a good balance between wooded areas and open moorland. An early integration of 3D visualization in the planning process offers a wide range of opportunities for exploring alternative futures but it also poses challenges to the expert planners such as being able to react timely, with a high degree of realism and interactively to incorporate new inputs from participating stakeholders. Furthermore, the planner is forced to translate a vision into concrete geographically referenced data. Only then the vision can be visualized. The full potential of 3D visualizations in the planning disciplines and in futures studies is still to be explored. The visualizations could be the basis to communicate the vision – the views of the future – and to share the vision with others in order to influence future change.}

abstract = {Local in its causes and global in its impacts, climate change still poses an unresolved challenge for scientists, politicians, entrepreneurs, and citizens. Climate change research is largely global in focus, aims at enhanced understanding, and is driven by experts, all of which seem to be insufficient to anchor climate change action in regional and local contexts. We present results from a participatory scenario study conducted in collaboration with the municipality of Delta in SW British Columbia, Canada. This study applies a participatory capacity building approach for climate change action at the local level where the sources of emissions and the mechanisms of adaptation reside and where climate change is meaningful to decision-makers and stakeholders alike. The multi-scale scenario approach consists of synthesizing global climate change scenarios, downscaling them to the regional and local level, and finally visualizing alternative climate scenarios out to 2100 in 3D views of familiar, local places. We critically discuss the scenarios produced and the strengths and weaknesses of the approach applied.}

  abstract={We develop the concept of virtual experiments and consider their application to environmental policy. A virtual experiment combines insights from virtual reality in computer science, naturalistic decision-making from psychology, and field experiments from economics. The environmental policy applications of interest to us are the valuation of wild fire management policies such as prescribed burn. The methodological objective of virtual experiments is to bridge the gap between the artefactual controls of laboratory experiments and the naturalistic domain of field experiments or direct field studies. This should provide tools for policy analysis that combine the inferential power of replicable experimental treatments with the natural \&quot;look and feel\&quot; of a field domain. We present data from an experiment comparing valuations elicited by virtual experiments to those elicited by instruments that have some of the characteristics of standard survey instruments, and conclude that responses in the former reflect beliefs that are closer to the truth.},

abstract = {Urban ecosystems consist of infrastructure features working together to provide services for inhabitants. Infrastructure functions akin to an ecosystem, having dynamic relationships and interdependencies. However, with age, urban infrastructure can deteriorate and stop functioning. Additional pressures on infrastructure include urbanizing populations and a changing climate that exposes vulnerabilities. To manage the urban infrastructure ecosystem in a modernizing world, urban planners need to integrate a coordinated management plan for these co-located and dependent infrastructure features. To implement such a management practice, an improved method for communicating how these infrastructure features interact is needed. This study aims to define urban infrastructure as a system, identify the systematic barriers preventing implementation of a more coordinated management model, and develop a virtual reality tool to provide visualization of the spatial system dynamics of urban infrastructure. Data was collected from a stakeholder workshop that highlighted a lack of appreciation for the system dynamics of urban infrastructure. An urban ecology VR model was created to highlight the interconnectedness of infrastructure features. VR proved to be useful for communicating spatial information to urban stakeholders about the complexities of infrastructure ecology and the interactions between infrastructure features.}
